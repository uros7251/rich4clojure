;; 
;; Write a function that returns a lazy sequence of
;; "pronunciations" of a sequence of numbers. A
;; pronunciation of each element in the sequence consists
;; of the number of repeating identical numbers and the
;; number itself. For example, [1 1] is pronounced as [2
;; 1] ("two ones"), which in turn is pronounced as [1 2 1
;; 1] ("one two, one one").
;; 
;; Your function should accept an initial sequence of
;; numbers, and return an infinite lazy sequence of
;; pronunciations, each element being a pronunciation of
;; the previous element.
