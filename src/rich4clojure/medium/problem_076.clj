;; The trampoline function takes a function f and a
;; variable number of parameters. Trampoline calls f with
;; any parameters that were supplied. If f returns a
;; function, trampoline calls that function with no
;; arguments. This is repeated, until the return value is
;; not a function, and then trampoline returns that
;; non-function value. This is useful for implementing
;; mutually recursive algorithms in a way that won't
;; consume the stack.
