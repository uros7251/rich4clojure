;; 
;; In trick-taking card games such as bridge, spades, or
;; hearts, cards are played in groups known as "tricks" -
;; each player plays a single card, in order; the first
;; player is said to "lead" to the trick. After all
;; players have played, one card is said to have "won" the
;; trick. How the winner is determined will vary by game,
;; but generally the winner is the highest card played in
;; the suit that was led. Sometimes (again varying by
;; game), a particular suit will be designated "trump",
;; meaning that its cards are more powerful than any
;; others: if there is a trump suit, and any trumps are
;; played, then the highest trump wins regardless of what
;; was led.
;; 
;; Your goal is to devise a function that can determine
;; which of a number of cards has won a trick. You should
;; accept a trump suit, and return a function winner.
;; Winner will be called on a sequence of cards, and
;; should return the one which wins the trick. Cards will
;; be represented in the format returned by Problem 128,
;; Recognize Playing Cards : a hash-map of :suit and a
;; numeric :rank. Cards with a larger rank are stronger.
