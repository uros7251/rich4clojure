;; = Comparisons =
;; By 4Clojure user: daowen
;; Difficulty: Easy
;; 
;; For any orderable data type it's possible to derive all
;; of the basic comparison operations (<, ≤, =, ≠, ≥, and
;; >) from a single operation (any operator but = or ≠
;; will work). Write a function that takes three
;; arguments, a less than operator for the data and two
;; items to compare. The function should return a keyword
;; describing the relationship between the two items. The
;; keywords for the relationship between x and y are as
;; follows:
;; 
;; * x = y → :eq
;; * x > y → :gt
;; * x < y → :lt

(def __ (fn [comp x y]
          (cond (comp x y) :lt
                (comp y x) :gt
                :else :eq)))

(tests
  :gt := (__ < 5 1)
  :eq := (__ (fn [x y] (< (count x) (count y))) "pear" "plum")
  :lt := (__ (fn [x y] (< (mod x 5) (mod y 5))) 21 3)
  :gt := (__ > 0 2))
